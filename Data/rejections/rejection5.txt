"thank you for your time and interest","hello [name], thank you for your interest in the summer 2024 internship role with coalfire. you could have applied anywhere, but you chose to pursue a career here and we really appreciate it. your skills and background are impressive, but we did receive some other applicants who more closely match our current needs. we know - not the message you were hoping to hear. but, this isn’t the end. we’ve been in your shoes before – getting this type of email. companies often say that they would like you to keep looking for other roles as they open and re-apply but yet you often never hear anything beyond your first application – and we also know that’s not ok. we have had several people that have been hired for openings even though the first job wasn’t the right one and always consider repeat applicants for new roles. having said that, we’d love to stay in touch. let’s connect on linkedin if we haven’t already so we can update each other as things change. if you want to stay engaged with us, follow us on linkedin, twitter, and glassdoor. thanks again for taking the time to share your information with us. we look forward to staying in touch – we mean it. the coalfire talent acquisition team","rejection"
